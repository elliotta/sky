Human Eyes
----------

* Cones see color and are concentrated near the center of your eyes.
* Rods are more sensitive than cones but only see in black and white.
* At night, there's not enough light for your cones, so you're using just the rods.
* A fully dark adapted human eye sees the equivalent of ISO 800, f/3.5, 1/5"
